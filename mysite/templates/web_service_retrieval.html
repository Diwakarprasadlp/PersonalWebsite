    <p>
        It is a basic automatic web service retrieval mechanism based on 7-D vector space and co-sine similarity. OWL is a service-description document which describes the document using rish semantics. We used this document associated with each web service to search for desired service.
    </p>
    <p>
        This project was done as a part of <i>Web Technologies and Applications</i> course between September to November, 2014.
    </p>
    <p>
        Web Service Interfaces was used to search for similar services. The &lt;&lt;<b>profile:hasinput</b>&gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt;<b>profile:hasoutput</b>&gt;&gt; was extracted for around 1000+ OWL documents in our data-set. Keywords in those interfaces was used to search for services.

                The web-services were classified into 7 categories :
                <ul class="disk">

            <div class="six columns">
                A 7-dimension vector space was considered where each of these mentioned category represents a dimension. Each service as well as user's query is represented as a vector in this vector space. After this, co-sine similarity is used to find services similar to user's query.
